This project analyzes pollution indicators per city and population per country to gather insights on the main factors leading to pollution using Python. To do so the following 6 Kaggle datasets are used: [World Population by Country](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajkumarpandey02/2023-world-population-by-country), [Global Air Pollution Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasibalmuzdadid/global-air-pollution-dataset), [World's Air Quality and Water Pollution Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorahaji/worlds-air-quality-and-water-pollution-dataset), [World Population](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammedtausif/world-population-by-countries?select=world-population-forcast-2020-2050.csv), [World Population Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset)

This project was completed as part of the course Master of Science in Computer Science (Data Science) at TU Dublin, Ireland.

The main steps of the project are outlined below:

- **Part 1** : Each dataset is loaded and cleaned individually, All the datasets are merged to create a single dataset
- **Part 2** : Exploratory Data Analysis, using histograms and boxplots in matplotlib, outliers inspection and removal, correlation matrix of quantitative features
- **Part 3** : 5 framed questions providing insights on subsets of the data by grouping data and creating graphs
